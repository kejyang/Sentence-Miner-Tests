# Sentence-Miner-Tests

This repo contains tests for the Sentence Miner website, for which the repo can be found with this link https://github.com/kejyang/Sentence-Miner. 
These tests use Selenium with python for regression testing on various ui features. The tests check to see if clicking on the sentence leads to the right
sentence page, if the search function works properly and if the create sentence function is working properly.

There are also two Postman collections that test the api. The Sentence Miner collection tests check if the api can get, post, put and delete properly. The bad path
checks to see if the api will respond properly to bad calls.
